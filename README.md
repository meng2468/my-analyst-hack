## 🚀 Features
- Your personal Live Data Voice Agent
- CSV-Upload (could be any size)
- Live Transcript, graph visualization, code and results streaming to frontend
- Code Execution for insights
- Defer Data Enrichment Task to the background with live updating Google Sheets and streaming to UI/Agent (currently requires ACI_API_KEY to handle auth with Google Sheets)

(if no ACI_API_KEY it still works, by live updating a pd df and saving to disk)

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Upload Your Dataset**
   - Click "Upload Dataset" on the home screen
   - Select a CSV file from your computer
   - The system will generate a unique session ID

2. **Start Voice Conversation**
   - Click "Connect" to establish voice connection
   - Grant microphone permissions when prompted
   - Begin speaking with your AI data analyst

3. **Analyze Your Data**
   - Ask questions like "What's in this dataset?"
   - Request specific analysis: "Show me sales trends"
   - Ask for visualizations: "Create a chart of revenue by month"
   - Request data enrichment: "Classify customer satisfaction levels"

### Example Conversations

**Basic Analysis:**
```
User: "What's in this dataset?"
AI: "I can see you have a sales dataset with 1,000 records. It contains columns for date, product, revenue, customer_id, and region. The data spans from January to December 2023."

User: "Show me the top 5 products by revenue"
AI: "Let me analyze that for you. The top 5 products by revenue are: Product A ($125,000), Product B ($98,000), Product C ($87,000), Product D ($76,000), and Product E ($65,000). I've also created a visualization showing this data."
```

**Advanced Analysis:**
```
User: "Can you identify any seasonal patterns in the sales data?"
AI: "I've analyzed the sales data and found clear seasonal patterns. Sales peak in Q4 (holiday season) with a 40% increase compared to Q1. There's also a summer dip in July-August. I've created a seasonal decomposition chart to visualize these patterns."

User: "Export this analysis to Google Sheets"
AI: "I've uploaded the seasonal analysis to Google Sheets. You can find the breakdown by quarter, monthly trends, and the seasonal decomposition data in separate sheets."
```

### Voice Commands

COPY . .
EXPOSE 7860

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Audio Connection Problems:**
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Check WebRTC support in your browser
- Verify no firewall blocking WebRTC traffic

**API Key Errors:**
- Verify API keys are correctly set in `.env` file
- Check API key permissions and quotas
- Ensure keys are valid and active

**File Upload Issues:**
- Verify CSV file format is valid
- Check file size limits
- Ensure proper file encoding (UTF-8 recommended)

**Performance Issues:**
- Monitor API usage and quotas
- Check network connectivity
- Verify sufficient system resources

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:
```bash
python main.py --verbose
```

### Health Checks

Test API endpoints:
```bash
curl http://localhost:7860/api/test
```

## 📈 Performance & Scaling

### Optimization Tips

1. **Audio Quality**: Adjust WebRTC settings for optimal latency vs quality
2. **API Usage**: Implement caching for repeated analysis requests
3. **Memory Management**: Monitor pandas DataFrame memory usage
4. **Concurrent Users**: Scale backend instances for multiple simultaneous users

### Monitoring

- Track API usage and costs
- Monitor WebRTC connection quality
- Log analysis performance metrics
- Monitor user session durations
